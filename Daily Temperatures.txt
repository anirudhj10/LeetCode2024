Daily Temperatures

Iterative Process:
Iterate through each temperature in the input list.
While the stack is not empty and the current temperature is greater than the temperature at the index stored at the top of the stack:
Pop the index from the stack.
Update the answer for the popped index based on the time difference between the current day and the popped index.
Repeat this process until the conditions are no longer met.s
