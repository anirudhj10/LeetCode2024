Longest Consecutive Sequence 

Create a set of the list to reduce the number of comparisons


Initialize longest = 0 -> check for starting of the sequence by checking if num -1 exists in the set -> if it does exits, it indicates the start of the sequence -> so initliaze length to 0 and check if it successor exists in the set, if it does increment the length by 1. Execution should execute the loop once no more successors are found. Then assign longest to the max value between the length and the initial longest value.

Return longest
